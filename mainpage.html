        <img src=" 03-naxli-aagjani.jpg " alt="Dantewada Music and Dance">
        <p>Dantewada, a district in Chhattisgarh, India, has been significantly impacted by Naxalism, a Maoist insurgency that started in the late 1960s. The Naxalite movement seeks to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare, primarily advocating <br>
            for the rights of marginalized communities. Dantewada, with its dense forests and remote locations, became a stronghold for Naxalites. The conflict has led to numerous violent incidents, loss of lives, and disruption of development activities.<br>
             Despite ongoing security operations and government initiatives to improve infrastructure and livelihoods, the region continues to face challenges due to Naxalism.</p>
