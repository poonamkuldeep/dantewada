                Traditional Farming: Tribal farmers in Dantewada rely on traditional seeds and cultivation methods, despite challenges. They produce crops comparable to modern techniques.
               <br>  Resource Dependence: The forest provides wood, fodder, and minor forest produce. Agriculture complements this resource-based livelihood.
               <br> Challenges: Population growth, poverty, and habitat disruption affect tribal communities.
               <br> Water Management: Practices include rainwater harvesting and efficient irrigation methods.

               <br> Remember, balancing development with ecological preservation is crucial. üå±üåø

                The Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) is a corpus of ‚Çπ5,000 crores created by the National Bank for <br>Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Its main objective is to help state governments expand and promote <br> micro irrigation technology across the country.
                The MIF prepares and organizes resources for<br> the expansion of micro irrigation by setting up special and innovative projects1. This initiative<br> aims to enhance water use efficiency at the farm level through micro irrigation systems such as drip and sprinkler irrigation

            The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is a scheme offered by the Government of India to farmers. Its objective is to fulfill<br> their short-term financial needs and specific credit requirements.
             Launched in 1998 by the National Bank for <br>Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the KCC provides timely and subsidized credit for agricultural and<br> allied activities. Farmers can
              use it for cultivation, post-harvest expenses, marketing loans, household <br>consumption, and investment needs12. The card is issued by banks and allows farmers to purchase <br>agricultural inputs and 
              withdraw cash for production purposes3. If you‚Äôre a farmer, consider exploring the KCC to<br> support your farming endeavors! üåæüöú

        <p> Farmers face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, low income, climate change, and marketing complexities.<br> Innovative solutions are needed to support them. üåæüåç</p>
         <section>   

            Crop Yields: Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can lead to decreased crop yields.<br>

            Heat Stress: Dairy cows are sensitive to heat stress, affecting their appetite and milk production.<br>

            Soil Erosion: Heavy rainfalls caused by climate change can lead to more soil erosion.<br>

             Droughts: Prolonged droughts reduce water availability for irrigation, impacting crop growth and yield.<br>

            Wildfires: Some farming communities are vulnerable to wildfires due to remote locations and limited firefighting resources.<br>

            Financial Impact: Extreme heat reduces crop yields, leading to decreased farm income.<br>

            Farmers must adapt to these challenges by implementing resilient practices. üå±üåç
